Description:
Takes in two matrices as files, and an integer for the number of threads to distribute the workload over. Multiplies the two matrices and writes their result to a file.

Usage: 
1) Verify you have the gcc compiler installed. Written using version 8.5.0.
2) Run the command "make" in the working directory. This will produce an executable called "mmult"
3) Create the matrices you want to multiply using the make_mat executable. For example, “make_mat MATRIX_1 4 5 1” will create a 4 by 5 matrix of all 1s. Note I am not the author of this program which is documented in the source file.
4) Multiply the matrices by running “mmult MATRIX_1 MATRIX_2 RESULT_NAME 10” where the first two matrices should already exist, the name of the resulting matrix is specified and the number of threads is 10 in this case.
