Description:
Simple implementations of the tar command line utility.

Usage:
1) Verify you have the gcc compiler installed. Written using version 8.5.0.
2) Run the command "make" in the working directory. This will produce an executable called "wytar".
3) Run the executable in the same way as you can the normal utility. -x extracts the archive, -c creates the archive and -f is the name of the archive. 
Note: It uses the same octal encoding scheme as GNU tar.
